The apps we build are available on both the Google Play and the App Store for the enlish-speaking market, and are free to download. The company's main revenue source is in-app ads. Therefore, the revenue for any given app is primarily governed by the number of users for that app.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Games\" are overwhelmingly the most common genre of free, english language app on the iOS App Store, accounting for over half of these apps (58.23%). The next most common genre is \"Entertainment\", accounting for only 7.84%. The remaining genres of app each account for 5% apps that meet this criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genres that fall in the wider category of entertainment (e.g. games, photo and video, social networking, sports, music) acccount for 6 of the top 9 most populated app categories. The number of apps that fall into the general category of practical/utility apps is far less, and only 3 of the top 9 ranking categories belong to this domain - the most populous being Education (3.69%), then \"Shopping\" (2.59%), then \"Utilities\" (2.47%).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the insight provided by this data is limited. Simply because a genre of app is more widely available, it does not imply that these apps have the most users or are most frequently used. If anything, it could be argued that the market for Game-based apps is saturated, and that a percentage of users within any given genre might be achieved by targetting an alternative genre. However, further analysis is needed to confirm the number of users per genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Play Store genre and category frequency analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common category of app in the Play Store is \"Family\", accounting for 18.93% of the number of apps and almost twice as common as the next most common category, \"Game\" (9.7%). However, 8 of the next 10 most common categories of apps (ranging from 3-9%) belong to the wider category of practical/utility apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the genres frequency table for hte Play store, one might initially suppose that there is a more even spread of app types. \"Tools\", \"Entertainment\", \"Education\" and \"Business\" are the most common four genres, each accounting for between 4.5-8.5% of the total number of apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this frequency table is less clear, as several apps are labelled as haveing multiple \"genres\"- for example \"Puzzle;Action & Adventure\". There is also ambiguity over genre labels, for example \"Educational\" and \"Education\" both describe the same genre of app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the iOS Store frequency tables, the insight provided by these tables are limited, and further analysis should be performed to assess the number of users and frequency of use of each app category. The data for Play Store genre is so messy, and it offers little more insight than the Play Store category frequency table. Therefore, it is proposed that the Play Store genre frequency table is ignored in this analysis."

    "Having this detailed breakdown allows a more insightful analysis. Although the \"Navigation\" genre has the highest mean number of user ratings, we can see here that the navigation market is actually dominated by 2 apps: \"Waze\" and \"Google Maps\". All other apps in this category receive a relatively low number of reviews. We can draw from this that gaining a foothold in the free, English speaking \"Navigation\" app market is challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also true for the \"Reference\" genre of apps, although less extreme. The high average number of ratings for this genre is mostly accounted for by 2 apps: \"Bible\" and \"Dictionary.com\". However, in this category there are a slightly higher number of apps in the range 10,000 - 100,000 user ratings. This indicates it is more achievable to build an \"Reference\" app that will draw a substantial number of users and generate a solid revenue stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "The breakdown for the \"Social Networking\" category shows a considerably different pattern. There are far more apps of this genre available for free in the English language on the iOS App Store. The top 2 apps by number of ratings (\"Facebook\" and \"Pinterest\") have a huge number of user ratings, exceeding 1M. However, there are many more apps with between 10,000-500,000 user ratings. This indicates that many app builders are finding success in creating Social Networking apps that draw a high number of users. In addition to this, it is important to consider the contextual understanding that the use of Social Networking apps is not mutually exclusive: i.e. it is common for individuals to be members of and use multiple different social media apps. This may not be true for other genres, e.g. Navigation apps."

    "- Neither data sets contain data describing the frequency of use by users. \n",

    "\n",
    "- For the Play Store, the lower bound of the total number of installs was used to calculate the mean number of installs per category. The \"Communication\" category was ranked first for mean app installs, but didnt feature as a genre on the iOS App Store. On further inspection, it was found that many of the most installed apps in the \"Communincations\" category were described as \"Social Media\" apps on the iOS App Store. \"Social Media\" apps ranked third most installed on the Google Play Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a conclusion, it is social media apps perform well on both the iOS App Store and the Play Store. There is a high number of high-performing social media apps as identified in the analysis of each data set. This is encouraging when considering launching a new social media app on either (or both) platforms. Hence, it is recommended that the company design a social media app for initial release on the Play Store."
